ABOUT
This document contains instructions for starting and stoping the server. Three
methods are described.  The MANUAL section describes how to stop and start
the server from the command-line by directly invoking the Java Virtual Machine.
The UNIX section describes how to start and stop the server using a script
and the 'service' program.  The WINDOWS section describes how to start and
stop the server as a Windows Service.

The shutdown mechanism requires a password to shutdown the server.  The
default password is 'shutdownpass'.  Instructions for changing the password
can be found in the configuration document, config.html.
