These instructions will guide you through the process of building the
Orangefood.com Servlet Engine.  Once build the next step is to
<a href="install.html">install</a> the servlet engine.

<h2><a name="ant">Ant</a></h2>
<p>
The build scripts are designed to work with the 
<a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>, a Java-based build tool.
The ant executable should be in your <code>PATH</code>.
</p>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>][<a href="index.html">home</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="quick">Quick &amp; Easy</a></h2>
<p>
The default build configuration will build the Server, supporting 
servlets and filters, and the JUnit test servlets and filters.
To build the servlet engine with the default configuration execute
<code>ant</code> from the based directory of the distribution tree.
</p>
<p>
example:<br/>
<code><b>$</b> ant</code><br/>
The resultant <code>JAR</code> file will be located in the
<code>release</code> directory.  See <a href="install.html">Installing the Orangefood Servlet Engine</a>
for information on how to install the servlet engine.
</p>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>][<a href="index.html">home</a>]</p>

<h2><a name="advanced">Advanced Build Configuration</a></h2>
<p>
The build can be configured to selectivly build individual components
and component features of the Orangefood.com Servlet Engine.  
See <a href="design.html">Design of the Orangefood.com Servlet Engine</a>
for information on the design of the components.
</p>
<p>
The configuration information is stored in a file called <code>configuration.properties</code>.
There is a version of this file in the base directory and in each component directoy.
</p>
<p>
There are two ways to configure the build system, manual edit the configuration 
files or use the <code>configure</code> target of the Ant build script.  
It is important to understand each component and when deciding which 
components to include.  The following section describes the available options.
</p>

<h3>Configuration Options</h3>
<p>
The Orangefood.com Servlet engine is broken down into four components
</p>
<ul>
<li>server (dependencies: none)</li>
<li>servlets (dependencies: server)</li>
<li>filters (dependencies: server)</li>
<li>JUnit (dependencies: server)</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are runtime dependencies that are not inforced by
the build script and are not well documented.  If you choose not to 
use the default build configuration you should be careful to satisfy 
those dependencies.
</p>

<h4>Base configuration</h4>
<p>
The base configuration identifies which components from the list above 
will be built.
</p>
<p>Directives:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>build_server</code> - Instructs the build system to build the server code</li>
<li><code>build_servlets</code> - Instructs the build system to build the default servlets</li>
<li><code>build_filters</code> - Instructs the build system to build this default filters</li>
<li><code>build_junit</code> - Instructs the build system to build the test code</li>
</ul>


<h4>Server configuration</h4>
<p>
The server component is the kernel of the Orangefood.com Servlet Engine if 
you do not build the server you will not have a servlet engine.
</p>
<p>Directives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<code>repackage_servlet_lib</code> - Causes the <code>servlet.jar</code>
	file to be expanded and its classes inclued in the 
	<code>orangefood-servletengine.jar</code> file.  This saves some space and
	allows the entire server to be distributed as a single file.  If the
	<code>servlet.jar</code> is not repackaged then it must be included in
	the <code>CLASSPATH</code> at runtime.
</li>
<li><code>http_support</code> - Instructs build system to include directives that 
	enable HTTP connections to the server in the <code>server.xml</code>.</li>
<li><code>https_support</code> - Instructs the build system to compile the 
	<code>SecureSocketListener</code> and configure the <code>server.xml</code>
	to listen for SSL conntection.</li>
<li><code>shutdown_support</code> - Instructs the build system to compile and
	configure the server to accept shut down commands on a socket.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Servlets configuration</h4>
<p>
The servlets component contains the functionality for a basic 
HTTP server, i.e. returning static files and returning indicies 
for directories.  
</p>
<p>Directives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>build_file</code> -
Instructs the build system to build the file servlet.  The file servlet 
is responsible for returning static content from a file on the file
system.
</li>
<li>
<code>build_index</code> - 
Instructs the build system to build the index servlet.  The index servlet 
is responsible for returning a directory index.  This servlet is called from
the file servlet when a &quot;welcome file&quot; is not found.  (dependencies:
file servlet.)
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Filters configuration</h4>
<p>
The default filters are responsible for parsing HTTP requests, 
managing sessions and logging access requests. 
</p>
<p>Directives:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>build_header</code> - 
Instructs the build system to build the header filter.  This filter reads HTTP 
headers from the request stream and places them in the request object.
(dependencies: none.)
</li>
<li>
<code>build_post</code> - 
Instructs the build system to build the post filter.  This filter reads 
the body of a <code>POST</code> request whose content type is
<code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.  (dependencies:
header filter.)
</li>
<li>
<code>build_cookie</code> -
Instructs the build system to build the cookie filter.  This filter takes
cookies from the HTTP headers and places them in the request object. (dependencies:
header filter.)
</li>
<li>
<code>build_session</code> -
Instructs the build system to build the session management filter.  This filter
uses cookies to maintain session information across multiple requests. (dependencies:
cookie filter.)
</li>
<li>
<code>build_logging</code> -
Instructs the build system to build the logging filter.  This filter logs all
requests using the Common Log File Format. (dependencies: none.)

</li>
</ul>

	
		
<h4>JUnit configuration</h5>
<p>
This directive instructs the build system to build the JUnit test code.
The test code depends on the HTTP parsing and Session filters.
</p>
<p>Directives:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>none</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Manual Configuration</h3>
<p>
The code and build configuration file for each component is located in 
directories named after the component beneath the based directory of the distribution directory.
A file called <code>configure.properties</code> is located in the base directory
and in each of the component directories.  These files contains the directives that determine
which features will be built.  To prevent a component of feature from being
build either remove the directive or comment out the directive by placing
the '#' character at the start of the line.  If you choose not to use the
default build configuration you should be careful to satisfy the dependencies.
</p>
<h3>Ant-based Configuration</h3>
<p>
You may also use ant to modify the build configuration by entering the following
command:<br/>
<code><b>$</b> ant configure</code>
</p>
<p>[<a href="#top">top</a>][<a href="index.html">home</a>]</p>


<h2><a name="targets">Other Ant Targets</a></h2>
<h3>Clean</h3>
<p>
To remove all generated code and runtime configuration files use the <code>clean</code>
target:<br/>
<code><b>$</b> ant clean</code><br/>
</p>
<h3>Debug</h3>
<p>
By default the java code is compiled without debuging information.  To include
debugging information use the <code>debug</code> target:<br/>
<code><b>$</b> ant debug</code>
</p>
