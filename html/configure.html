This document contains information on the configuration of the Orangefood.com Servlet Engine.
There are two configuration files that define the runtime behavior of the server, <code>server.xml</code>
 which contains configuration options for the entire server and <code>web.xml</code> which 
 contains configuration information for the servlet context.
</p>
<h2><a name="server.xml"><code>server.xml</code></a></h2>
<p>
The <code>server.xml</code> file contains information that describes propritary configuration
options for the Ornagefood.com Servlet Engine.  Specifically this file describes, 
<code>servlet contexts</code> within which the servlets run, <code>listeners</code> that 
listen for connections on a specific TCP port and <code>handlers</code> that handle the
connection once it has been made to the server.  The releationship between these concepts is
as follows. The server may have one or more <code>listeners</code> that listens for connections,
each listner must reference a handler which will handle the connextion.  Every handler must reference
a <code>context</code> within which the connection will be processed.
</p>
<p>
The file is formated as an XML file. The top element is <code>&lt;server&gt;</code>.  Within
the server element the following elements are supported, in order, 
<code>&lt;tempdir&gt;</code>, 
<code>&lt;context&gt;</code>, 
<code>&lt;handler&gt;</code>, 
<code>&lt;listener&gt;</code>.
The <code>&lt;tempdir&gt;</code> element specifies the temporary working directory for the
server.  Individual contexts will have their own temporary directory below this.  If not
provided the server will use the <code>java.io.tmpdir</code> system property as the 
temporary directory.  If the element specifies a relative directory then that directory is created 
below the temporary directory given by <code>java.io.tmpdir</code>.
</p>

<h3>Listener</h3>
The server comes with two listeners, a <code>com.orangefood.se.net.TCPSocketListener</code>
that listens for connections on a TCP port, a <code>com.orangefood.se.net.SecureSocketListener</code>
that listens for connections using SSL.  The <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code> element takes two
attributes, <code>name</code>, a unique name that serves to identify the listener uniquely and
<code>class</code>, the fully qualified class name that implements <code>com.orangefood.se.net.SocketListener</code>.
Within the <code>&lt;listener&gt;</code> the following child elements are supported for
the <code>com.orangefood.se.net.TCPSocketListener</code>:
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;bind-address&gt;</code> - The address of the local interface on which to listen. 
If not provided this listener listens on all interfaces</li>
<li><code>&lt;port&gt;</code> - The local port on which the listener listens.  A value of 0
causes the listener to listen on any free port.</li>
<li><code>&lt;listen-timeout&gt;</code> - Sets the length of time in milliseconds that
the listener waits for a connection.  A value of 0 is interpreted as an infinite timeout.  The 
longer the timeout the longer it will take the server to shutdown.  For example is the timeout
is set to 1000, then every second the listening socket will timeout and the listener will
check if it should keep running.  If the value were set to 0 then the server would block
indefinatly and if it never received a connection would never check it's run status and
would therefore never shutdown gracefully.  If not provided the default value is 5000 milliseconds
(5 seconds).</li>
<li><code>&lt;read-timeout&gt;</code> - Sets the length of time to keep the socket open 
when no data is avaibale.  The length is specified in milliseconds.  If not provided
the default value is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The <code>com.orangefood.se.net.SecureSocketListener</code> listener supports
two additional child elements:
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;keystore&gt;</code> - The name of the keystore file that contains the 
server certificate.</li>
<li><code>&lt;keystore-password&gt;</code> - The password for the keystore</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Handler</h3>
<p>
Handlers accept sockets connections that have been received from listeners.  
Handlers understand the application level protocol and process the connection 
accordingly.  The server comes with one handler 
(<code>com.orangefood.se.http.HttpHandler</code>) for processing hypertext 
transfer protocol (HTTP) connections and another special purpose handler, <code>com.orangefood.se.ShutdownHandler</code>
, that handles requests to stop the server.
The <code>&lt;handler&gt;</code> element takes two
attributes, <code>name</code>, a unique name that serves to identify the handler and
<code>class</code>, the fully qualified class name that implements 
<code>com.orangefood.se.net.SocketHandler</code>. Within the 
<code>&lt;handler&gt;</code> element the following child elements are supported for
the <code>com.orangefood.se.http.HttpHandler</code>:
<ul>
<li>&lt;context&gt; - The context to use when processing connections.</li>
<li>&lt;scheme&gt; - The scheme the expected protocol, e.g. http or https.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The <code>com.orangefood.se.ShutdownHandler</code> takes only one
child element, <code>&lt;password&gt;</code>.  This is the password
used to shutdown the server.  It is a good idea to change this password 
from the default as anyone with this access to the shutdown port (specified
in the shutdown listener) can stop the server with knowledge of this password.
If you do change either the port or the password be sure to update the shutdown
scripts with the new information.  For Unix users edit <code>/etc/sysconfig/orangefood-servletengine</code>.
Windows users will have to provide the correct information on the command line
for <code>ntservice.bat</code> when <a href="install.html#windows_service">configuring</a>
the server as a Windows Service.
</p>

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>
The context describes an environment in which conntections are processed
multiple handlers can reference the same context.  For example an HTTP and HTTPS
could handle connections for the same context.  WIthin the <code>&lt;context&gt;</code>
element the following child elements are supported:
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;tempdir&gt;</code> - The name of the temporary directory for this context.  If
the directory is realitive then the directory is created below the server's temporary directory
otherwise the absolute directory is used. If this element is not provided then a randomly generated
directory name below the server temporary directory is used.</li>
<li><code>&lt;hostname&gt;</code> - The hostname to which the context applys.</li>
<li><code>&lt;document-root&gt;</code> - The location of the document root where the 
HTML files are located and under which the <code>WEB-INF</code> directory can be found.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2><a name="web.xml"><code>web.xml</code></a></h2>
<p>
The <code>web.xml</code> file is the XML based deployment descriptor described in chapter SRV.13
of the Servlet 2.3 specification.  Within the configuration directory (see the 
<a href="run.html#options">run</a> document for instructions on how to set the configuration directory)
a global <code>web.xml</code> contains configuration information that applys to all 
contexts.  Additionally the <code>web.xml<code> found in the <code>WEB-INF</code> directory
below the context <code>document-root<code> (see above) contains configuration information
unique to that context.
</p>
<p>
A complete description of the Servlet 2.3 deployment descriptor is beyond the scope of this 
document.  Detailed information can be found in chapter SRV.13 of the 
<a href="http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/first/jsr053/index.html">Java Servlet Specification Version 2.3</a>.
