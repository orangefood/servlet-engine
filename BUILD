ABOUT
This document contains instructions for building and installing the 
orangefood.com Servlet Engine.

PREREQUISITES
The build scripts are designed to work with the Ant 1.6.0 or later, a 
Java-based build tool. The ant executable should be in your PATH.  
The Ant tool can be found at
http://ant.apache.org

BUILD
The simplest way to build the orangefood.com Servlet Engine is:

1. 'cd' to the direcory containing the package's source code.
2. Type 'ant' to build the package.  note: ant must be installed (see PREREQUISITES)
3. Type 'ant install' to install the package.  The default locations for the install
   are:
   For windows: c:\Program Files\
   For Unix: /usr/local/
   To install to a different location set the directory by passing it on the
   command line: 'ant install -Dprefix=[dir]' where [dir] is the directory
   to install under.  Advanced configuration can be found in the config.html
   document in the 'html' directory.

This procdure will build the orangefood.com Servlet Engine using the default
configuration.

To start the server read the RUN document.  To install the server to an alternate
location read the INSTALL document.
