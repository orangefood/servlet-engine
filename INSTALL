INSTALLING
Advanced configuration and instalation instructions can be found in the 
config.html document in the 'html' directory or if the server has been 
started (see the RUN document) the file can be viewed at:
http://localhost:8008/config.html

QUICK & EASY INSTALL
You can use the Ant build software (http://ant.apache.org) to install the 
server.
1. 'cd' to the directory that contains project
2. type: 'ant install'
This will install the server to the default location.
The default location for the install is:
  windows - C:\Program Files\orangefood-servletengine\
  unix    - /usr/local/orangefood-servletengine/
The documents are served fromt the html directory below the install directory.

The location of the install can be changed by passing a prefix variable to Ant.
For example, 'ant install -Dprefix=/home/user/' will install the server to
/home/user/orangefood-servletengine

MANUAL INSTALL
You can manually install the Servlet Engine simply by copying the binary
jar file.
To install the server:
1. Create a directoy to hold the program.  e.g 'mkdir /usr/local/of-servlet'
2. Copy the .jar file, to that directry.
   e.g. 'cp orangefood-servletengine.jar /usr/local/of-servlet'
3. Create a directory to hold the HTML documents. 
   e.g. 'mkdir /usr/local/of-servlet/html'
   
STARTUP SCRIPTS
The distribution comes with startup scripts for Unix and Windows. The 
scripts are in the 'scripts' directory.

Unix
On Unix ant install will install an init script to /etc/init.d and an assocated 
configuration file to /etc/sysconfig.  The init script is compatible with 
the chkconfig program.  To add the server to the starup and shutdown sequences
with chkconfig type 'chkconfig --add ornagefood-servletengine'

If you manually installed there server you will need to copy the Unix start
scripts to the approprate locations.  Copy 'scripts/orangefood-servletengine'
to '/etc/init.d'.  Copy 'scripts/sysconfig/orangefood-servletengine' to
'/etc/sysconfig/'.

Windows
The Orangefood.com Servlet Engine can be installed as a Service under windows.
The JavaService program from Alexandria Software Consulting is used for this
purpose.  The program can be downloaded from 
http://www.alexandriasc.com/software/JavaService/index.html.  

A script is provided to install and configure the service.  
Before you run the script to install the service you must have 
satisfied these prerequisites:
 * Installed the Orangefood.com Service Engines
 * Downloaded and unpacked the JavaService program
 * Set the JAVA_HOME environment varriable to the location of the JRE

The script assumes that you have installed the Servlet Engine to
C:\Program Files\orangefood-servletengine\ and that you have unpacked 
the JavaService program to C:\Program Files\javaservice.  

If you have installed the Servlet Engine and the unpacked the JavaService 
program to their defualt locations you can simply run ntservice -install. 
If you did not used the default locations you can use the following command 
line parameters to configure the service appropratly.
-server_dir [path] 	    Sets the directory the server is installed in
-javaservice [path] 	Sets the path to the JavaService program
-password [password] 	Sets the shutdown password to use
-port [port] 	        Sets the port number for the shutdown listener
